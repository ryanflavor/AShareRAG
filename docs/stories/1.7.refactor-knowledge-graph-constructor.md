## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- **Component Location**: All components reside in `src/components/`
- **Adapter Pattern**: Use adapters in `src/adapters/` for third-party integrations (LLM, embedding, reranker)
- **Configuration**: Use `config/settings.py` for all configurable values

### Key Refactoring Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one clear architectural responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive dependencies through constructor, not create them
3. **Configuration Externalization**: No hardcoded values in component code

### Implementation Details from Optimization Document
- The current `KnowledgeGraphConstructor` implementation is production-grade with good error handling, file operations, and deduplication logic
- This refactoring is architectural improvement, NOT a rewrite
- Preserve all existing logic while redistributing responsibilities

### Critical Implementation Guidelines

#### For VectorIndexer Creation (Task 1)
- Move the entire "Step 5: Generate and store embeddings" block from `KnowledgeGraphConstructor.process_documents`
- The `index_documents` method should accept:
  - `documents`: List of document chunks
  - `ner_re_results`: Dictionary containing extracted entities and relations
- Preserve all batch processing logic, error handling, and retry mechanisms
- Keep the same logging patterns for consistency

#### For KnowledgeGraphConstructor Refactoring (Task 2)
- The class should ONLY handle:
  - Entity extraction via LLM
  - Relation extraction via LLM
  - Graph vertex creation and deduplication
  - Graph edge creation and deduplication
  - Graph statistics and persistence
- Remove ALL code related to embeddings and vector storage
- Update imports to remove `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStorage`

#### For Pipeline Implementation (Task 4)
- Location: Create or update `src/pipeline.py` (check if it exists first)
- The pipeline should handle:
  - Component initialization with proper dependency injection
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Progress tracking and logging
  - Checkpoint management between components

### Dependency Injection Example
```python
# Before:
def __init__(self):
    self.llm_adapter = LLMAdapter()

# After:
def __init__(self, llm_adapter: LLMAdapter):
    self.llm_adapter = llm_adapter
```

### Component Interfaces

#### KnowledgeGraphConstructor
```python
class KnowledgeGraphConstructor:
    def __init__(self, llm_adapter: LLMAdapter):
        """Initialize with injected LLM adapter"""
        
    def process_documents(self, documents: List[Dict]) -> tuple[dict, ig.Graph]:
        """Process documents to extract entities/relations and build graph"""
        # Returns: (ner_re_results, knowledge_graph)
```

#### VectorIndexer
```python
class VectorIndexer:
    def __init__(self, embedding_service: EmbeddingService, vector_storage: VectorStorage):
        """Initialize with injected services"""
        
    def index_documents(self, documents: List[Dict], ner_re_results: dict) -> None:
        """Generate embeddings and store in vector database"""
        # No return value - stores directly to vector storage
```

#### Pipeline
```python
def run_offline_pipeline(corpus_path: str = "data/corpus.json") -> None:
    """Orchestrate the complete offline data processing pipeline"""
    # 1. Initialize all components with proper dependencies
    # 2. Load documents via DataIngestor
    # 3. Process with KnowledgeGraphConstructor
    # 4. Index with VectorIndexer
```

### Error Handling Specifications

1. **VectorIndexer Error Scenarios**:
   - Embedding service connection failures → Log error, raise exception
   - Vector storage write failures → Log error, attempt retry (3x), then raise
   - Invalid document format → Skip document, log warning, continue
   - Memory errors during batch processing → Reduce batch size, retry

2. **Pipeline Error Scenarios**:
   - Component initialization failure → Log detailed error, exit with clear message
   - Intermediate processing failure → Save checkpoint, allow resume from failure point
   - Complete pipeline failure → Ensure partial results are preserved

### Configuration Values to Externalize

```python
# config/settings.py additions
ENTITY_TYPE_PRIORITY = [
    "COMPANY", "PERSON", "LOCATION", "ORGANIZATION", 
    "DATE", "MONEY", "PERCENT", "PRODUCT"
]

GRAPH_PRUNING_THRESHOLD = 1_000_000  # Maximum graph size before pruning

# Optional: Batch processing settings
PROCESSING_BATCH_SIZE = 32
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS = 1.0
```

### Testing

#### Test Standards (from Architecture Document)
1. **Mandatory TDD Process**:
   - Always create failing test FIRST before implementation
   - Write minimal code to make test pass
   - Refactor under test protection
   
2. **Test Locations**:
   - Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_*.py`
   - Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_*.py`
   
3. **Test Requirements**:
   - All tests must 100% pass in CI
   - Use pytest framework (~8.2.2)
   - Mock external dependencies in unit tests
   - Use real components in integration tests

4. **Coverage Requirements**:
   - Aim for >90% code coverage for new components
   - Focus on edge cases and error handling

#### Example Test Scenarios

**VectorIndexer Tests**:
```python
# test_vector_indexer.py
def test_index_documents_success():
    """Test successful document indexing"""
    
def test_index_documents_with_empty_ner_results():
    """Test handling of documents with no entities"""
    
def test_index_documents_batch_processing():
    """Test batch processing with large document sets"""
    
def test_index_documents_storage_failure_retry():
    """Test retry mechanism on storage failures"""
```

**KnowledgeGraphConstructor Tests**:
```python
# test_knowledge_graph_constructor.py
def test_dependency_injection():
    """Test LLMAdapter is properly injected"""
    
def test_process_documents_without_embeddings():
    """Test that no embedding operations occur"""
    
def test_entity_deduplication():
    """Test entity merging logic is preserved"""
```

**Integration Tests**:
```python
# test_offline_pipeline.py
def test_complete_pipeline_execution():
    """Test end-to-end pipeline with sample data"""
    
def test_pipeline_component_failure_handling():
    """Test pipeline handles component failures gracefully"""
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Both components should maintain the existing batch processing approach
- **Checkpoint Strategy**: Save intermediate results after each major step
- **Parallel Processing**: Consider if embedding generation can be parallelized in VectorIndexer
- **Resource Monitoring**: Maintain existing memory usage tracking and logging

### Debug Log References

**2025-07-07 15:36 CST - Critical Bug Fix & Architecture Validation**
- **Issue**: User reported that `load_and_preprocess_documents` method not found in `src/pipeline/offline_pipeline.py`
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - Method name mismatch between `DataIngestor` class and pipeline code
  - `DataIngestor` class has method: `load_corpus(corpus_path: str | Path) -> list[Document]`
  - Pipeline code was calling: `load_and_preprocess_documents(str(corpus_path))`

- **Deep Investigation**: 
  - Read optimization guide `/home/ryan/workspace/github/AShareRAG/docs/optimization/knowledge_graph_constructor_optimization.md`
  - Verified current implementation follows optimization guide requirements correctly
  - Component interfaces are properly aligned with single responsibility principle
  - Dependency injection is implemented correctly across all components

- **Architecture Validation**:
  - ✅ `KnowledgeGraphConstructor`: Properly refactored, uses dependency injection, no embedding logic
  - ✅ `VectorIndexer`: Properly handles embedding and vector storage responsibilities
  - ✅ `DataIngestor`: Returns `Document` objects as expected
  - ✅ Pipeline: Correctly converts `Document` objects to dictionary format for component compatibility

- **Critical Bug Found**: Pipeline metadata extraction logic was incorrectly handling nested `ner_re_results` structure
  - Expected flat structure: `{"entities": [], "relations": []}`
  - Actual nested structure: `{"doc_1": {"entities": [], "triples": []}, ...}`

- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. **Method Name**: Updated `offline_pipeline.py:96` to use correct method name
  2. **Metadata Logic**: Fixed lines 127-149 to properly extract metadata from nested structure
  3. **Test Compatibility**: Updated integration tests to use proper `Document` object mocking

- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/home/ryan/workspace/github/AShareRAG/src/pipeline/offline_pipeline.py`
  - `/home/ryan/workspace/github/AShareRAG/tests/integration/test_offline_pipeline.py`

- **Validation Results**: All 9 integration tests pass, confirming proper architecture implementation
- **Status**: Fixed, architecture validated, ready for production

**2025-07-07 Final Interface Cleanup**
- **Issue**: Found incorrect method call in unit test using non-existent `extract_entities_relationships` method
- **Location**: `/home/ryan/workspace/github/AShareRAG/tests/unit/test_knowledge_graph_constructor.py:45`
- **Root Cause**: Test was mocking a method that doesn't exist in the LLM adapter interface
- **Correct Interface**: LLM adapter has separate methods:
  - `extract_entities(text, include_types=True) -> list[dict[str, str]]`
  - `extract_relations(text, entities) -> list[list[str]]`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated test to mock the correct separate methods
- **Validation**: All 31 unit tests for KnowledgeGraphConstructor pass
- **Status**: All interfaces confirmed correct, no remaining old method calls
