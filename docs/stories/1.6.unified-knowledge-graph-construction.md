# Story 1.6: Unified Knowledge Graph Construction

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system developer,  
**I want** to build and persist a unified knowledge graph that aggregates all entity and relation data from processed documents,  
**so that** the system has a complete, deduplicated, and queryable graph structure for downstream retrieval operations

**Parent Epic:** Epic 1 - 基础数据管道与索引构建 (Foundational Data Pipeline & Indexing)  
**Epic Scope:** FR1-FR6 (This story implements FR4: 统一知识图谱构建)

**Prerequisites:** 
- Story 1.3 (Relation Extraction) - Required for triple extraction functionality
- Story 1.2.1 (Named Entity Recognition with Type Classification) - Required for typed entity format

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Knowledge Graph Constructor aggregates all triples from all documents into a single, unified igraph
2. Entity deduplication is performed when building the graph (entities with same text are merged)
3. Relation merging handles multiple occurrences of same relations between entities
4. Graph includes comprehensive metadata: entity types, first document seen, relation sources
5. Graph is persisted to disk in GraphML format for portability and reuse
6. Graph loading functionality allows resuming from previously saved graphs
7. Graph statistics are logged: total vertices, edges, connected components
8. Memory-efficient processing for large document sets (incremental graph building)
9. Proper error handling for graph operations and file I/O
10. Unit tests verify graph construction, deduplication, and persistence
11. Integration tests validate end-to-end graph building from corpus
12. Code passes ruff format checks and maintains existing quality standards

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- **Story 1.3**: Basic igraph construction already implemented with entity vertices and relation edges
- **Story 1.2.1**: Typed entity format `[{"text": str, "type": str}]` must be handled correctly
- **Story 1.5**: Knowledge graph is used alongside vector storage for hybrid retrieval

### Graph Implementation Details
- **Graph Library**: python-igraph >=0.11.0 (already in dependencies) [Source: pyproject.toml#L8]
- **Storage Format**: GraphML for portability and human readability
- **File Location**: `Path("output/graph")` directory as configured [Source: config/settings.py#L45]
- **Vertex Attributes**: 
  - name: Entity text (string)
  - entity_type: Type from NER (COMPANY, PERSON, etc.) [Source: Story 1.2.1]
  - first_seen: Document ID where first encountered
  - occurrence_count: Number of documents mentioning this entity
- **Edge Attributes**:
  - relation: Predicate text (string)
  - source_docs: List of document IDs where relation found
  - confidence: 1.0 for LLM-extracted relations
  - first_seen: Timestamp of first occurrence

### Deduplication Strategy
- **Entity Deduplication**: 
  - Use normalized entity text as unique identifier
  - Merge vertices with identical text
  - Preserve most specific entity type when merging
  - Track all documents where entity appears
- **Relation Deduplication**:
  - Allow multiple edges between same vertex pair (different relations)
  - For identical relations, merge and track all source documents
  - Preserve highest confidence score when merging

### Memory Optimization
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches (batch_size: 100 documents per batch)
- **Incremental Building**: Add vertices/edges incrementally, not all at once
- **Memory Cleanup**: Explicitly clear temporary data structures between batches using `gc.collect()`
- **Large Graph Handling**: For graphs >1M edges, prune vertices with degree < 2 to reduce memory usage
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage with `psutil` and log warnings if usage exceeds 80%

### File Structure and Naming
```
output/
├── graph/
│   ├── knowledge_graph.graphml     # Main graph file
│   ├── graph_metadata.json         # Graph statistics and metadata
│   └── graph_backup_YYYYMMDD.graphml  # Timestamped backups
```

### GraphML Format Benefits
- Human-readable XML format
- Preserves all vertex and edge attributes
- Supported by major graph analysis tools
- Can be visualized in Gephi, Cytoscape, etc.
- Smaller file size compared to JSON representation

### Integration Points
- **Input**: NER/RE results from Knowledge Graph Constructor
- **Processing**: Entity deduplication and relation merging
- **Output**: Persistent GraphML file for Epic 2 retrieval
- **Performance**: Optimized for A-share corpus scale (~1000 companies)

### Error Handling Requirements
- File permission errors: Check write permissions before saving
- Disk space errors: Verify sufficient space before write
- Corrupted files: Validate GraphML structure on load
- Memory errors: Implement batch processing with cleanup
- Network errors: N/A (all operations are local)

### Testing Considerations
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Use small test graphs (10-20 vertices) for fast execution
  - Mock file I/O with `unittest.mock` to avoid filesystem dependencies
  - Test GraphML save/load with various graph structures
  - Test error scenarios: disk full, permission denied, corrupted files
  - Verify all vertex/edge attributes are preserved through persistence
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test with realistic data volumes (100-1000 documents)
  - Verify graph statistics calculation accuracy
  - Test concurrent read/write scenarios
  - Validate backup rotation with 3 backup files max
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure memory usage during batch processing
  - Benchmark save/load times for various graph sizes
  - Test pruning effectiveness on large graphs

### Security and Compliance
- **Data Protection**:
  - No sensitive data in graph structure (only public company information)
  - GraphML files are not encrypted (acceptable for public data)
- **File Security**:
  - Validate file permissions before read/write operations (check using `os.access()`)
  - Prevent directory traversal attacks by validating file paths
  - Implement file size limits to prevent disk exhaustion (max 2GB per graph file)
- **XML Security**:
  - Validate GraphML structure to prevent XML injection attacks
  - Use `defusedxml` library for secure XML parsing
  - Sanitize all string attributes before writing to GraphML
- **Access Control**:
  - Set output directory permissions to 755 (owner write, others read)
  - Implement file locking during write operations to prevent corruption
- **Backup Security**:
  - Rotate backups with maximum 3 files to prevent disk exhaustion
  - Validate backup integrity with checksums
