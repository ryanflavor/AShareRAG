## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack Integration
- **Embedding Model**: Qwen3-Embedding-4B (2560 dimensions) via existing basic_embedding_advanced.py
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB for local vector storage and similarity search
- **Memory Management**: GPU optimization and batch processing from Qwen3EmbeddingManager
- **Integration Point**: Knowledge Graph Constructor as orchestrator

### Existing Assets to Leverage
- **Qwen3EmbeddingManager**: Complete implementation in reserved/basic_embedding_advanced.py
- **Memory Management**: Auto-retry OOM handling, context managers, performance monitoring
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes with progress tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and fallback mechanisms

### Architecture Integration Points
- **Input**: Documents with processed NER/RE results from Knowledge Graph Constructor
- **Processing**: Text embedding generation with metadata preservation
- **Output**: Searchable vector database ready for retrieval in Epic 2
- **Performance**: Optimized for A-share corpus scale (efficient batch processing)

### Vector Storage Schema
```python
# LanceDB Table Schema - UPDATED for Story 1.2.1 Compatibility
{
    "id": "doc_id_chunk_id",              # Unique document chunk identifier
    "text": "text_content",               # Original text content
    "vector": [0.1, 0.2, ...],           # 2560-dim vectors from Qwen3
    "company_name": "公司名称",             # From title field
    "doc_id": "document_id",             # Original document ID
    "chunk_index": 0,                    # Chunk index within document
    # FIXED: Updated to handle typed entities from Story 1.2.1
    "entities": [
        {"text": "entity1", "type": "COMPANY"},
        {"text": "entity2", "type": "PRODUCT"}
    ],
    # ENHANCED: Add relation triples for better metadata
    "relations": [
        ["subject", "predicate", "object"]
    ],
    "relations_count": 5,
    # ADDED: Source tracking
    "source_file": "corpus.json",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-01-06T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Configuration Requirements
Add to config/settings.py:
- VECTOR_DB_PATH: LanceDB storage location (default: ./output/vector_store)
- EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE: Batch size for embedding generation (default: 32)
- EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME: Model identifier (default: Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B)
- VECTOR_TABLE_NAME: LanceDB table name (default: ashare_documents)

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory Optimization**: Use Qwen3EmbeddingManager's auto-retry OOM handling
- **Batch Processing**: Configure optimal batch sizes based on available GPU memory
- **GPU Utilization**: Leverage existing CUDA optimization from embedding manager
- **Storage Efficiency**: LanceDB's built-in indexing for fast similarity search

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Embedding Failures**: Retry with smaller batch sizes, fallback to CPU if GPU OOM
- **Storage Failures**: Retry database operations, create tables if missing
- **Integration Errors**: Graceful degradation, continue processing other documents
- **Memory Issues**: Automatic cleanup and resource management

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Input Stage**: Knowledge Graph Constructor provides processed documents with NER/RE results
2. **Embedding Stage**: EmbeddingService generates vectors using Qwen3EmbeddingManager
3. **Storage Stage**: VectorStorage persists embeddings and metadata to LanceDB
4. **Query Stage**: Vector search interface ready for Epic 2 retrieval operations
