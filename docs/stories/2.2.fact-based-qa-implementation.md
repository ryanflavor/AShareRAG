# Story 2.2: Fact-based Q&A Implementation

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system developer,  
**I want** to implement the fact-based Q&A flow that retrieves, reranks, and synthesizes answers from the vector database,  
**so that** users can get accurate, sourced answers to their factual questions about companies

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system must implement a vector retrieval component (FR-A1) that searches the LanceDB vector database based on user queries
2. Retrieved documents must be filtered by the company entity mentioned in the query
3. The system must implement a reranking component (FR-A2) using the Qwen3-Reranker-4B model to reorder results by relevance
4. The reranker must follow the pattern from `qwen3_reranker_official_best_practice.py` in the reserved folder
5. The system must implement an answer synthesis component (FR-A3) that uses DeepSeek V3 to generate concise, factual answers
6. All answers must include source citations from the retrieved text chunks
7. The complete fact-based Q&A flow must integrate with the existing IntentRouter from Story 2.1
8. API endpoints must be created to expose the fact-based Q&A functionality via FastAPI
9. Response time for the complete flow should be under 30 seconds (considering DeepSeek uncached responses ~20s)
10. All components must follow the existing adapter pattern and project structure
11. Unit tests must achieve 100% coverage for core logic
12. Integration tests must validate the end-to-end flow from query to answer
13. All code must follow the TDD workflow and pass quality checks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 implemented the IntentRouter which classifies queries as "fact_qa" or "relationship_discovery". The router is located in `/src/intent_detection/` and can be imported using:
```python
from src.intent_detection.router import IntentRouter
```
The router returns a `QueryRouteResult` dataclass with intent type and metadata. This story (2.2) will handle all queries routed with intent_type="fact_qa".

### Architecture Context
Based on the architecture documents, this story implements components #5, #6, and #7 from the system architecture for the fact-based Q&A flow.

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/1-架构概述与核心原则.md]
- **Python**: ~3.10
- **Vector Database**: LanceDB v0.24.0 (already implemented)
- **Embedding Model**: Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B (already implemented)
- **Reranker Model**: Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-4B
- **LLM**: DeepSeek V3 (deepseek-chat)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI ~0.115.6
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2

### Component Specifications

**Vector Retriever** [Source: architecture/2-核心架构组件与交互流程.md]
- Location: `/src/components/retriever.py`
- Integrates with existing VectorStorage (`/src/components/vector_storage.py`)
- Uses EmbeddingService (`/src/components/embedding_service.py`) for query embedding
- Returns top-k results with similarity scores

**Reranker** [Source: architecture/2-核心架构组件与交互流程.md]
- Adapter Location: `/src/adapters/reranker_adapter.py`
- Component Location: `/src/components/ranker.py`
- Reference Implementation: `/reserved/qwen3_reranker_official_best_practice.py`
- Uses generative scoring approach with yes/no probabilities

**Answer Synthesizer** [Source: architecture/2-核心架构组件与交互流程.md]
- Location: `/src/components/answer_synthesizer.py`
- Uses DeepSeek adapter for summarization
- Prompt templates in `/config/prompts.yaml`

### Existing Patterns to Follow

**Adapter Pattern** (from existing codebase):
```python
# Base class: /src/adapters/llm_adapter.py
# Example implementation: /src/adapters/deepseek_adapter.py
# Pattern: Abstract base class with concrete implementations
```

**Component Pattern** (from existing codebase):
```python
# Example: /src/components/vector_storage.py
# Pattern: Initialize with config, connect(), process(), disconnect()
```

**Configuration Pattern**:
- Settings in `/config/settings.py` using Pydantic BaseSettings
- Prompts in `/config/prompts.yaml`
- Environment variables from `.env`

### Technical Implementation Details

**FR-A1 (Vector Retrieval)**:
- Use existing VectorStorage connection at `./output/vector_store`
- Query embedding using EmbeddingService
- Filter by company_name in metadata
- Return documents with similarity scores

**FR-A2 (Reranking)**:
- Implement based on `/reserved/qwen3_reranker_official_best_practice.py`
- Use generative scoring with logits for "Yes"/"No"
- Batch processing with OOM recovery
- Memory-efficient mode for production

**FR-A3 (Answer Synthesis)**:
- Use existing DeepSeekAdapter or extend for Q&A
- Design Chinese-language prompt for factual summarization
- Include source chunk references in output
- Reference: `/reserved/rag_qa_chinse_companies.py` for prompt patterns

### API Endpoint Design
```
POST /api/v1/query
Request:
{
  "query": "string",
  "company": "string (optional)",
  "top_k": "integer (default: 10)"
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "string",
  "sources": [
    {
      "content": "string",
      "company": "string",
      "score": "float"
    }
  ],
  "intent": "fact_qa",
  "processing_time_ms": "integer"
}
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/4-ai开发工作流与交付标准.md]
- Mandatory TDD workflow
- Write failing tests first
- Unit tests: `/tests/unit/test_*.py`
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/test_*.py`
- API tests: `/tests/api/test_*.py`
- Performance tests with benchmarks
- 100% coverage for core logic

### Performance Constraints (MVP)
- Total response time: < 30 seconds (realistic for DeepSeek)
- Component targets:
  - Embedding: < 1s
  - Vector retrieval: < 2s
  - Reranking: < 5s (for 10 docs)
  - DeepSeek synthesis: < 20s (uncached)
- Simple in-memory caching for embeddings only

### Error Handling Requirements
- Handle FR12(a): Company not found in dataset
- Graceful degradation if reranker fails
- Fallback to top retrieval results if synthesis fails
- User-friendly error messages in Chinese/English

### Testing

Testing must follow the mandatory TDD workflow with tests written before implementation.
