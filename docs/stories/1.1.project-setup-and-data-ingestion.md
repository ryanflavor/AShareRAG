# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Data Ingestion

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system developer,  
**I want** to set up the project foundation with proper configuration and implement data ingestion from corpus.json,  
**so that** we have a working development environment and can load company data for further processing

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Project is properly initialized with Python 3.10 and uv package manager
2. All required dependencies from tech stack are installed and configured
3. Project follows the defined directory structure from architecture
4. Configuration system is implemented using Pydantic Settings to load environment variables
5. Data ingestion module can successfully read and parse corpus.json file
6. Each document's text field is treated as a single chunk (no splitting) as per FR1
7. Unit tests exist for all implemented functionality following TDD approach
8. Code passes ruff format checks

### Epic 1 Context (Source: PRD Epic 1 & FR1-FR6)
This story is the first of Epic 1: 基础数据管道与索引构建, which includes:
- FR1: Document Processing (this story)
- FR2: Named Entity Recognition (future story)
- FR3: Relation Extraction (future story) 
- FR4: Knowledge Graph Construction (future story)
- FR5: Text Embedding (future story)
- FR6: Vector Indexing (future story)

### Data Processing Requirements (Source: PRD FR1)
- System must read `corpus.json` format
- Each document's complete `text` field is one chunk (no splitting)
- This differs from typical text splitting - we treat entire documents as chunks

### Corpus.json Structure Example
```json
[
  {
    "title": "公司简称",      // Company short name
    "text": "# 公司全称\n\n## 公司简称\n...",  // Full company info in markdown
    "idx": 0                // Unique index number
  },
  // ... more company documents
]
```
Each document contains:
- **title**: Company name/identifier
- **text**: Complete company information in markdown format including business segments, products, services
- **idx**: Unique numeric index

### Development Standards (Source: architecture/4-ai开发工作流与交付标准.md)
- **Mandatory TDD**: Write failing test first, then minimal implementation
- All tests must pass 100% before marking complete
- Code must pass `ruff format` checks
- Fill in Dev Agent Record section when complete

### Design Principles (Source: architecture/1-架构概述与核心原则.md)
- Use HippoRAG as library without modifying its source
- All customizations via adapter classes
- Maintain clear separation between graph and vector storage

### Testing

Testing Standards from Architecture:
- Use pytest framework (~8.2.2)
- Tests go in `tests/unit/` for unit tests
- Follow strict TDD: test first, then code
- 100% test pass rate required
- Test file naming: `test_[module_name].py`

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-05
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates solid understanding of the requirements and follows good Python practices. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns between configuration, data ingestion, and testing. The comprehensive test suite with 15 tests shows excellent TDD practice.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: config/settings.py
  - **Change**: Updated import ordering to follow PEP8 standards
  - **Why**: Import statements should be grouped and ordered (standard library, third-party, local)
  - **How**: Reorganized imports with proper grouping, improving code readability

- **File**: config/settings.py  
  - **Change**: Updated type annotations from `Optional[str]` to `str | None`
  - **Why**: Modern Python 3.10+ syntax is more concise and readable
  - **How**: Uses PEP 604 union type syntax, reducing dependency on typing module

- **File**: src/components/data_ingestor.py
  - **Change**: Updated type annotations to use modern Python syntax
  - **Why**: Consistency with Python 3.10+ standards and better readability
  - **How**: Changed `Union[str, Path]` to `str | Path` and `List[Document]` to `list[Document]`

- **File**: src/components/data_ingestor.py
  - **Change**: Improved exception chaining with `from e`
  - **Why**: Proper exception chaining preserves the original error context
  - **How**: Added `from e` to re-raised JSONDecodeError for better debugging

- **File**: src/components/data_ingestor.py
  - **Change**: Fixed line length violations in error messages
  - **Why**: PEP8 recommends 88 character line limit for better readability
  - **How**: Split long f-strings across multiple lines using proper string concatenation

- **File**: Multiple test files
  - **Change**: Fixed import ordering and removed unused imports
  - **Why**: Consistent code style and cleaner codebase
  - **How**: Reorganized imports following standard conventions

- **File**: tests/unit/test_settings.py
  - **Change**: Changed generic `Exception` to specific `ValueError` in test
  - **Why**: Tests should catch specific exceptions for better error detection
  - **How**: Updated to expect ValueError when attempting to modify frozen settings

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows PEP8 and project conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches architecture specification exactly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria verified and satisfied

### Improvements Checklist
[x] Fixed import ordering across all project files
[x] Updated type annotations to modern Python 3.10+ syntax
[x] Improved exception handling with proper chaining
[x] Fixed all line length violations
[x] Removed unused imports
[x] Updated test to use specific exception types

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. The implementation properly:
- Uses Pydantic for secure configuration loading
- Validates all input data types in data ingestion
- Doesn't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Handles file operations safely with proper encoding

### Performance Considerations
The implementation is efficient for the current use case:
- Single-pass JSON parsing without unnecessary iterations
- Frozen Pydantic settings prevent runtime modifications
- Appropriate use of dataclasses for immutable data structures

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

Excellent work! The implementation is clean, well-tested, and follows all project standards. The refactoring performed enhances code quality while maintaining functionality.
