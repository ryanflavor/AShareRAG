# Story 1.4: Performance Optimization for LLM Operations

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** system developer,  
**I want** to optimize LLM adapter performance by integrating high-performance HTTP clients and caching mechanisms,  
**so that** the system achieves significant performance improvements and reduces redundant API calls

**Parent Epic:** Epic 1 - 基础数据管道与索引构建 (Foundational Data Pipeline & Indexing)  
**Epic Scope:** Performance optimization for FR2-FR3 (NER and RE operations)

## Scope Clarification

This story represents a **performance optimization** of existing functionality rather than new feature implementation. While Epic 1 encompasses FR1-FR6 for building the foundational data pipeline, this optimization work is essential to ensure the pipeline operates efficiently at scale. The performance improvements directly enhance the NER (FR2) and RE (FR3) operations that have already been implemented in Stories 1.2 and 1.3, making them production-ready with acceptable performance characteristics.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FastLLMAdapter is integrated as the primary LLM adapter with high-performance HTTP client configuration
2. SQLite-based caching mechanism is enabled for all LLM operations (NER and RE)
3. HTTP connection pooling is properly configured with 500 max connections and 100 keepalive connections
4. Retry mechanism with exponential backoff is maintained for API failures
5. Architecture-level duplicate API calls are eliminated in KnowledgeGraphConstructor
6. Performance improvements achieve at least 50% reduction in processing time for repeated operations
7. Cache hit rate monitoring and statistics are available
8. All existing functionality continues to work correctly
9. Unit tests verify caching behavior and performance improvements
10. Integration tests confirm end-to-end performance gains
11. Code passes ruff format checks and maintains 100% test pass rate

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.3 implemented RE functionality with typed entity support from Story 1.2.1
- Current LLMAdapter has retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- DeepSeek API configuration managed through environment variables
- Project uses uv package manager for dependencies

### Performance Analysis Results
Based on test_fast_adapter.py analysis:
- **Original Performance**: 26.9 seconds total for test corpus
- **Optimized Performance**: 16.5 seconds (38% improvement)
- **Cache Effectiveness**: 99.9% time savings on repeated calls
- **API Latency**: 99.7% of processing time is API calls

### Architecture Design Principles (Source: architecture/1-架构概述与核心原则.md)
- All LLM interactions must go through adapters in src/adapters/
- Follow "encapsulation and injection" pattern
- No direct modification of third-party library internals
- Configuration-driven approach using Pydantic Settings

### Existing Implementation Assets
- **FastLLMAdapter**: Already implemented at src/adapters/fast_llm_adapter.py
- **OptimizedLLMAdapter**: Alternative implementation at src/adapters/optimized_llm_adapter.py
- **Performance Scripts**: Analysis tools in scripts/ directory
- **Cache Implementation**: SQLite-based with SHA256 hashing and FileLock

### HTTP Client Configuration (Source: fast_llm_adapter.py)
```python
limits = httpx.Limits(max_connections=500, max_keepalive_connections=100)
timeout = httpx.Timeout(300.0, read=300.0)  # 5分钟超时
transport = httpx.HTTPTransport(limits=limits, http2=True)
```

### Cache Implementation Details
- **Location**: .cache/llm/llm_cache.db (SQLite database)
- **Key Generation**: SHA256 hash of (model, messages, temperature)
- **Concurrency**: FileLock ensures thread-safe access
- **Cache Methods**: 
  - `@cache_response` decorator for automatic caching
  - `clear_cache()` for cache management
  - `get_cache_stats()` for monitoring

### Component Integration Points (Source: architecture/2-核心架构组件与交互流程.md)
- **KnowledgeGraphConstructor**: Main component calling LLM operations
- **Current Flow**: Document → NER → RE → Graph Construction
- **Optimization**: Eliminate duplicate NER calls between initial extraction and RE

### Testing Standards (Source: architecture/4-ai开发工作流与交付标准.md)
- Use pytest framework (~8.2.2)
- Unit tests in tests/unit/
