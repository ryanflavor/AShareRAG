## Dev Notes

### Technology Stack (Source: architecture/1-架构概述与核心原则.md)
- **LLM Provider**: DeepSeek V3 (designated for NER and RE tasks)
- **Python**: ~3.10
- **Testing**: Pytest ~8.2.2 with strict TDD approach
- **Config Management**: Pydantic Settings for environment variables
- **Code Quality**: ruff for formatting

### Component Architecture (Source: architecture/2-核心架构组件与交互流程.md)
The Knowledge Graph Constructor (Component #2) is responsible for:
- Receiving text chunks from Data Ingestor
- Calling NER through LLM Adapter
- Later will call RE (Relation Extraction) in next story
- Outputs to igraph for graph construction

### LLM Adapter Design Principles (Source: architecture/1-架构概述与核心原则.md)
- All LLM interactions must go through adapters in src/adapters/
- Adapters encapsulate prompt management and API calls
- No direct modification of HippoRAG internals
- Follow "encapsulation and injection" pattern

### NER Prompt Template Structure (Source: reserved/ner_chinese.py)
```python
prompt_template = [
    {"role": "system", "content": ner_system},
    {"role": "user", "content": one_shot_ner_paragraph},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": one_shot_ner_output},
    {"role": "user", "content": "${passage}"},
]
```

Expected output format:
```json
{"named_entities": ["entity1", "entity2", "entity3", ...]}
```

### Entity Types to Extract (Based on one-shot example)
- Company names (公司名称)
- Stock codes (股票代码)
- Business sectors (业务板块)
- Subsidiary companies (子公司)
- Products and services (产品/服务)
- Technologies (技术)
- Application domains (应用领域)
- Key business terms

### Configuration Requirements
Add to .env.example and settings.py:
- DEEPSEEK_API_KEY: API key for DeepSeek V3
- DEEPSEEK_API_BASE: Base URL for DeepSeek API (default: https://api.deepseek.com/v1)
- DEEPSEEK_MODEL: Model name (default: deepseek-chat)

### Error Handling Strategy
- API timeouts: Implement exponential backoff retry (max 3 attempts)
- Malformed responses: Log error and return empty entity list
- Rate limiting: Implement request throttling if needed
- Connection errors: Graceful degradation with clear error messages

### Data Flow
1. Data Ingestor loads corpus.json → List of Documents
2. Knowledge Graph Constructor receives documents
3. For each document:
   - Extract text content
   - Call LLM Adapter's extract_entities(text)
   - Store document → entities mapping
4. Return complete entity extraction results

### Testing

Testing Standards from Architecture:
- Use pytest framework (~8.2.2)
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Follow strict TDD: write test first, then implementation
- 100% test pass rate required
- Mock external dependencies (DeepSeek API) in unit tests
- Use fixtures for test data setup

### Important Notes from Story 1.1
- Project uses uv package manager
- Configuration loaded via Pydantic Settings from environment
- Each document's text field is treated as single chunk (no splitting)
- Comprehensive error handling expected for all edge cases

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-06
### Reviewed by: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
### Overall Status: APPROVED WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

### Code Quality Assessment

#### Architecture & Design (Score: 8.5/10)
**Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns with LLM Adapter pattern
- Proper encapsulation following "encapsulation and injection" principles
- Well-structured component hierarchy
- Clear data flow from Data Ingestor → Knowledge Graph Constructor → LLM Adapter

**Improvements Needed:**
- Consider dependency injection for LLM Adapter in Knowledge Graph Constructor for better testability
- Add interface/protocol definition for future adapter implementations

#### Implementation Quality (Score: 8/10)
**Strengths:**
- Robust error handling with exponential backoff retry logic
- Proper configuration management using Pydantic Settings
- Clean JSON response parsing with multiple format handling
- Good logging throughout components

**Code Issues Found:**
- **Type Hints**: Using deprecated `typing.List` and `typing.Dict` instead of built-in `list` and `dict`
- **Import Organization**: Several files have unsorted imports
- **Minor Code Smells**: 
  - Unnecessary `str()` conversion in `llm_adapter.py:85`
  - Could use `dict.get()` instead of key checking in `llm_adapter.py:107`
  - Unused imports in test files

**Refactoring Suggestions:**
```python
# In llm_adapter.py - Better error handling pattern
def extract_entities(self, text: str, max_retries: int = 3) -> list[str]:
    if not (text := text.strip()):  # Use walrus operator
        logger.debug("Empty text provided, returning empty entity list")
        return []
    
    # Consider extracting retry logic to decorator
    @retry_with_backoff(max_retries=max_retries)
    def _extract():
        messages = self._build_messages(text)
        response = self._call_llm(messages)
        return self._parse_response(response)
```

#### Testing Strategy (Score: 7/10)
**Strengths:**
- Good unit test coverage for main functionality
- Integration tests verify end-to-end flow
- Proper mocking of external dependencies

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Missing Edge Cases:**
   - No tests for FileNotFoundError when prompts.yaml is missing
   - No tests for invalid prompt structure
   - Missing document ID generation fallback tests
   - No concurrent processing tests

2. **Test Quality Issues:**
   - Integration tests mock too heavily, reducing their value
   - No performance/load testing
   - Missing property-based testing for entity extraction
   - No tests for memory/resource cleanup

**Recommended Additional Tests:**
```python
# Example: Property-based testing with hypothesis
@given(text=st.text(min_size=1, max_size=10000))
def test_extract_entities_never_crashes(text):
    adapter = LLMAdapter()
    result = adapter.extract_entities(text)
    assert isinstance(result, list)
    assert all(isinstance(e, str) for e in result)
```

#### Security & Performance (Score: 9/10)
**Strengths:**
- API keys properly managed through environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets
- Rate limiting consideration with retry logic
- Low temperature setting for consistent results

**Recommendations:**
- Add request timeout configuration
- Consider adding circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- Implement request queuing for high-volume scenarios
- Add API key validation on initialization

#### NER Prompt Configuration (Score: 9/10)
**Strengths:**
- Excellent one-shot example covering diverse entity types
- Clear system prompt in Chinese
- Well-structured JSON output format
- Comprehensive entity coverage for A-share domain

**Minor Improvements:**
- Consider adding few-shot examples for edge cases
- Document expected entity normalization rules
