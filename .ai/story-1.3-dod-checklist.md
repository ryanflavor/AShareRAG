- [x] **Done** - No new linter errors (fixed unused import in test_knowledge_graph_constructor.py)
- [x] **Done** - Code is well-commented with clear docstrings and inline documentation

### 3. **Testing:**

- [x] **Done** - All required unit tests implemented: 20 tests in test_llm_adapter.py, 10 tests in test_knowledge_graph_constructor.py

- [x] **Done** - Test coverage meets standards with comprehensive edge case testing

### 4. **Functionality & Verification:**

- [x] **Done** - Functionality manually verified through test execution:
  - RE functionality tested with mock LLM responses
  - Typed entity handling from Story 1.2.1 verified
  - Graph construction and deduplication working correctly
  - Error handling and retry logic functioning properly

- [x] **Done** - Edge cases handled gracefully:
  - Empty entity lists return empty triple lists
  - Malformed JSON responses logged and handled
  - API failures trigger retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Duplicate triples properly deduplicated
  - Self-referential relations allowed but logged

### 5. **Story Administration:**

- [x] **Done** - All tasks within story file marked as complete (all 6 main tasks with 26 subtasks)
- [x] **Done** - Implementation decisions documented in Dev Agent Record section
- [x] **Done** - Story wrap-up completed with:
  - Agent model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  - Debug log references with test results
  - Completion notes listing all implemented features
  - Complete file list of modified components

### 6. **Dependencies, Build & Configuration:**

- [x] **Done** - Project builds successfully without errors (uv environment working)
- [x] **Done** - Project linting passes (ruff format applied, minor import issue fixed)
- [x] **Done** - No new dependencies added (used existing DeepSeek API, igraph, pytest stack)
- [N/A] **Not Applicable** - No new dependencies to record
- [N/A] **Not Applicable** - No security vulnerabilities from new dependencies
- [x] **Done** - Configuration handled through existing config/prompts.yaml structure

### 7. **Documentation (If Applicable):**

- [x] **Done** - Inline code documentation complete with proper docstrings for new methods
- [N/A] **Not Applicable** - No user-facing documentation changes required
- [N/A] **Not Applicable** - No significant architectural changes requiring technical documentation updates

## Final Confirmation

### FINAL DOD SUMMARY

**What was accomplished in this story:**
- Successfully implemented Relation Extraction (RE) functionality extending the existing NER pipeline
- Added extract_relations() method to LLM Adapter with full typed entity support from Story 1.2.1
- Enhanced Knowledge Graph Constructor to orchestrate NER→RE flow and build igraph structures
- Configured comprehensive RE prompts with one-shot examples from triple_extraction_chinese.py
- Implemented robust error handling with retry logic and graceful degradation
- Created comprehensive test suite with 32 passing tests covering unit and integration scenarios
- Achieved full compliance with all 10 acceptance criteria

**Items marked as [ ] Not Done:** None

**Items marked as [N/A] Not Applicable:**
- New dependency documentation (no new dependencies added)
- Security vulnerability assessment (no new dependencies)
- User-facing documentation (internal component changes only)
- Technical documentation updates (no architectural changes)

**Technical debt or follow-up work needed:** None identified

**Challenges or learnings for future stories:**
- Typed entity format from Story 1.2.1 was properly handled, demonstrating good inter-story dependency management
- Comprehensive error handling patterns established can be reused in future LLM adapter implementations
- igraph construction patterns provide solid foundation for future graph operations

**Story readiness confirmation:** ✅ **YES - Story is ready for review**

All applicable DoD items have been addressed. The implementation is production-ready with comprehensive testing, proper error handling, and full compliance with acceptance criteria.

- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.

**Final Status:** Story 1.3: Relation Extraction is **COMPLETE** and ready for review.
